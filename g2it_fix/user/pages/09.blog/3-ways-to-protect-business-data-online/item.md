<p><img style="float: right;" src="/blog/3-ways-to-protect-business-data-online/3 - 3 ways to protect business data online.jpg" alt="3 ways to protect business data online - G2IT " width="400" height="286" />Many parts of business are conducted almost entirely online these days, which means businesses do not have a choice but to be smart about their online security. There are many ways to protect yourself and your business from ransomware, file loss, and all the other more sinister parts of the internet.<br /><br /><strong>1. Back up your files consistently</strong><br /><br />This is the oldest piece of advice in computer history, and yet people still fail to do it. The trick is to set up a system, be it a cloud-based computer filing system that you can access from multiple devices, a physical hard drive with automatic backup capabilities, or some other system, the only way to ensure consistency is to set it and forget it. This is important if your computer crashes, but there is also a nasty trick where hackers can deny you access to your computer and your files unless you pay a hefty fee. You may still be at some risk but your best bet to avoid that situation is to invest in an automated backup system.<br /><br /><strong>2. Password protect your documents</strong><br /><br />Many of the applications your business uses on a day-to-day basis, like Microsoft Office, probably will allow you to set passwords on individual files. You can also set the type of encryption you want to use. Unfortunately, these types of protections are reasonably easy to crack for experienced hackers. It's like locking your door; you know there's still risk involved but at least you are not leaving your important files completely unprotected.<br /><br /><strong>3. Outsource your cybersecurity</strong><br /><br />A large number of the things that will most effectively protect your business from data security breaches are higher-level, and best carried out by a professional. This will give you peace of mind, knowing that your business is in safe hands. Let G2IT take care of things like backing up and file encryption, while also dealing with things that take a lot longer and require a lot more expertise, leaving you to focus on the day-to-day running of your business without worrying about online safety.</p>
