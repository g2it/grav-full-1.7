<h4 class="hero__headline" style="text-align: center;"><strong>YubiKey enables strong two-factor, multi-factor and passwordless authentication, protecting employees, customers and partners against phishing attacks.</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent high-profile hacks exposed how a single breach can adversely affect a large number of industry and government agencies in one fell swoop. The average enterprise uses 288 applications, along with various on-premises and cloud infrastructures. If even a single hardware or software vendor in an organisation&rsquo;s supply chain gets hacked and effective security measures aren&rsquo;t in place, there&rsquo;s a high chance of a successful cyber attack.</p>
<p>Consequences can include business downtime or lost revenue, and also a breach of trust between the organisation and vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there is no silver bullet to prevent a cyber attack, there are many well established practices and technologies that can help ensure that organisations can compartmentalise any damage, detect breaches quickly, and respond and recover before the adversaries get too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
