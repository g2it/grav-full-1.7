### What to expect during a commercial WiFi or wireless network set-up with G2IT

Our qualified technicians will thoroughly research and analyse the requirement, plan and deliver your WiFi network project. This way you don’t have to deal with network and system failures after installation, which can negatively impact your business.

Our technicians will check in detail what your network requirements are, such as:

* Expectations and requirements of stake holders 
* Required capacity for software used, estimated traffic, bandwidth needed 
* Appropriate coverage and placement of hardware and equipment 
* Possible sources of interference
* Number of access points and users 

Based on these specifications we will recommend, source and supply suitable equipment, such as firewalls, access points and switches. G2IT’s professionals will ensure that all pieces of wireless equipment are pre-configured before installation, thus minimising disruptions during set-up on site.

Once the equipment is installed, we run various tests to ensure that the wireless network meets or surpasses performance and throughput requirements. Our technicians will optimise the installation to your needs and can provide [managed services](https://www.g2it.com.au/our-services/managed-it-services) to monitor the installation and ensure that the network always runs at optimum performance.
