**Get the right hardware & software for your business with expert IT procurement advice by G2IT.**

### What is hardware & software procurement?

IT procurement is the process of acquiring information technology products and services. IT procurement involves both strategic and administrative responsibilities, such as requesting quotations and proposals, requests for information and managing supplier relationships. 

The procurement process includes conducting market research, price negotiation, establishing terms and conditions for services, resolving invoice discrepancies and communicating the status of purchases with stakeholders. 

Evaluating and procuring hardware and software without expert advice can be a time-consuming, high-risk and resource-draining exercise for your business. The team at G2IT has the knowledge and skills necessary to procure hardware and software for you efficiently and with a minimum of disruption to your organisation. 

You’ll benefit from G2IT’s exclusive relationships with the largest ICT vendors globally, along with high volume buying power. We will take the time to understand your business requirements and make unbiased recommendations according to your business needs.

We will handle the hardware and software procurement process, see you through project implementation and assist you with old hardware decommissioning, while providing an end-to-end management service.

G2IT’s IT procurement service includes but not limited to:

* Server and storage equipment (IBM, HP, Dell, LENOVO, Nutanix)
* Server and storage software (Microsoft, Linux, Nutanix, Veeam, StorageCraft)
* Workstations, POS and mobile devices (Lenovo, HP, Dell, Senor)
