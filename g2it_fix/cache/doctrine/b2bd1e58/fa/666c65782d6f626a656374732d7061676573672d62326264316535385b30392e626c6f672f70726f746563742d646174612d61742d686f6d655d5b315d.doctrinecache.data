<p>With the Coronavirus spreading across the world and forcing many people into social isolation and lockdown, many of us are now working from home. This is uncharted territory for a lot of people, who are used to offices with powerful internet services and workstations regulated by stringent IT security.<br /><br />At home, many people have basic Internet connections with standard security measures like password protection. But they could be vulnerable to cyber-attack as criminals seek to find and exploit weak points in workplaces that have suddenly switched from well-protected centralised networks to distributed ones.&nbsp;<br /><br />In these uncertain times, it&rsquo;s vital that companies and workers alike beef up their cybersecurity so businesses can continue to function unimpeded.<br /><br /><strong>Review your security measures</strong><br /><br />Whether you have a company seeking to send workers home or someone working remotely, it&rsquo;s a wise move to review the security measures you already have in place and ensure they are all working.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your desktop computer or laptop equipped with the latest internet security measures?</li>
<li>Are you able to use encryption services?</li>
<li>Is your home internet connection secure?</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you thoroughly review the protections you have in place and make sure they are up to the very latest standards.<br /><br /><strong>Develop strong IT protection measures</strong><br /><br />It&rsquo;s a wise move for any companies sending workers to log-on at home that they develop customised security plans for this situation.<br /><br />Developing extra security measures like using a Virtual Protected Network (VPN) can add extra layers of protection that will allow workers to log on from outside sources that can be trusted.<br /><br />If you are working from home, it&rsquo;s vital to follow your company&rsquo;s IT instructions to the letter so your computer doesn&rsquo;t become a weak point.<br /><br /><strong>Get expert help from G2IT<br /></strong><br />At G2IT we specialise in creating personalised IT services for businesses in and around Perth and Esperance, and are readily available to help home users as well.<br /><br />We can help your company and its workers ensure that when they work from home they're able to do so securely, allowing your business to continue without interruption from malicious cyber-attacks or data theft.</p>
