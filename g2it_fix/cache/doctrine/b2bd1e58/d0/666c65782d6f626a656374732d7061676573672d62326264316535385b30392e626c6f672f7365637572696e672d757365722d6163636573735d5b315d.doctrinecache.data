If you own or manage a small business, you may think securing access control is not something your business has to worry about; however, this could put your business at serious risk. Below we explain everything you need to know about securing user access.<br /><br /><strong>What does securing user access mean?</strong><br /><br />The aim of access control is to minimise the risk of unauthorised users accessing your online systems and data. Access control also involves limiting the access certain employees have to sensitive information, such as customer data. In light of the recent introduction of GDPR, access control has become an essential part of security compliance to ensure confidential information is stored and used carefully.<br /><br /><strong>What tools are available to help control user access?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double opt-in<br />Double opt-in is a tool usually used to ask individuals to confirm twice they consent for their data to be stored or they have access to a particular section of a network. For example, users may have to click a link and then fill out an information box, so they do not accidentally consent to give their information or access information they shouldn't by accident.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Two-factor authentication<br />Two-factor authentication is a login process that consists of two steps. For example, a user may have to provide their username and password and then their two-factor pin. This is to ensure that should sensitive information such as a password be stolen, a criminal with malicious intent is still unable to access the protected information.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Biometric data<br />Biometric data is an advanced user access control as it requires an individual to physically prove who they are. This may require a fingerprint to be scanned or voice waves, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the trends for securing user identities?</strong><br /><br />- Privileged accounts: Instead of giving all of your employees the same access to online information, privileged accounts are used to ensure only the relevant staff members have access to certain information<br /><br />- Education: A business must ensure all of its employees are updated on relevant cybersecurity, for example, they must be able to spot a social engineering cyberattack tactic rather than accidentally giving out their personal information.</p>
