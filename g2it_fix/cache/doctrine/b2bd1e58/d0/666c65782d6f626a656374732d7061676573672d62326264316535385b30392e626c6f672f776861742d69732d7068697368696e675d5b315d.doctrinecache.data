Ensuring that your staff are prepared for the dangers is a key element to any cyber security strategy. Phishing, most commonly a scam completed through email, is a threat that could wreak havoc on your data security and is one that should be kept in mind.</p>
<p>Let us discuss phishing:</p>
<p><br /><strong>Definition</strong><br /><br />"Phishing" is in essence, a communication that appears legitimate, but is fraudulent. A physical version of this would be a caller claiming to represent the government, and then asking you to confirm personal information, such as birth dates, account passwords or credit card details.</p>
<p>Given the digital age, the most common method is through mass emails, that will appear to come from your bank, a government department, or a service provider (such as MyGov or Synergy). The email will often be intended to scare and prompt action, claiming that "your bill is due, click here NOW to fix this!".</p>
<p>Upon clicking the link, your computer will then either be infected with viruses (<a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/blog/protect-business-from-ransomware">such as ransomware</a>), and / or you will be asked to input confidential information, which will be used by a scammer to gain access to your accounts.<br /><br /><strong>Securing your business against phishing</strong><br /><br />The most important thing to do to combat phishing scams is to train your staff to never click any links that are not confirmed from a verified source.</p>
<p>For example, a receptionist will likely not receive any bills, since those would go to accounts payable or a manager.</p>
<p>Therefore, if receptionists were to receive an email from (for example) a power company, it is likely a phishing scam, and any links within that email should not be clicked.</p>
<p>Another important guard is the installation of antivirus software that has a spam filter. In these days, spam filters have developed to also combat phishing scams. They may also come with add-ons to 'report' emails as phishing, thus training your staff to report anything suspect.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Summary</strong><br /><br />Phishing is a common scam that anyone can fall for if they are not careful. One click on a link could cause an internet security failure, even if the person does not give the phisher their personal details.</p>
<p>Training and anti-virus/filtering software are two key strategies for combatting phishing.
