    priceRange: $";s:8:"markdown";s:1418:"CISCO SYSTEMS INC. IS THE WORLDWIDE LEADER in networking for the Internet. The company was founded in 1984 by two computer scientists from Stanford University seeking an easier way to connect different types of computer systems.

Cisco Systems shipped its first product in 1986 and is now a multi-national corporation, with over 35,000 employees in more than 115 countries. Today, Cisco solutions are the networking foundations for service providers, small to medium business and enterprise customers which includes corporations, government agencies, utilities and educational institutions.

Cisco's networking solutions connect people, computing devices and computer networks, allowing people to access or transfer information without regard to differences in time, place or type of computer system.

If anyone can lay claim to a 'heritage' in an industry as young as global networking, then it is Cisco. Not only does 85 per cent of Internet traffic travel across Cisco's systems, we also use the Internet to run our own business online, from product orders and inventory management through to staff communications and travel expenses.

So as you explore the possibilities for your business, start at the beginning. Cisco Systems built the Internet so we know exactly what it takes to get your business online. Take advantage of our experience and knowledge to get the Internet working effectively for your business.";}s:7:"storage";a:6:{s:3:"key";s:18:"our-partners/cisco";s:11:"storage_key";s:24:"06.our-partners/05.cisco";s:8:"template";s:7:"partner";s:17:"storage_timestamp";i:1633959748;s:8:"markdown";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:7:"partner";i:1633959748;}}s:8:"checksum";s:32:"7e798d117a812f258dc13c717900ca6a";}}}
