Having a malicious person take your systems down with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack would be a catastrophe. It's a complex topic, so today we're just going to touch on a few basics relating to this common internet security threat.<br /><br /><strong>What is a DDoS attack?<br /></strong><br />A DDoS attack can come in many forms, but the most basic one is a malicious person or group getting virus-infected computers to send data to your system all at once. A common analogy is a massive roadblock which prevents anyone who wants to use the road from being able to turn onto it.</p>
<p>Given the scary nature of the attack, what can we do about it?<br /><br /><strong>Engage in basic security principles<br /></strong><br />The first thing is to have the basics set in absolute stone. If an attack from the outside is dangerous, once combined with something from the inside, it could prove to be extremely costly. Having the basics of data security down pat will help to minimise the risk. Things like having a strict firewall that prevents a lot of outside traffic, having good password policies, and so on - it's all going to contribute to a safer system.<br /><br /><strong>Have a plan<br /></strong><br />The thing with DDoS attacks is that they are sudden and violent, so needing to think and decide on the spot is not ideal. A pre-set plan should be in place with either your internal IT team or your external cybersecurity team, such as G2IT, which outlines what everyone is going to do in this scenario. This might mean, for example, shutting down a certain system and issuing a communication to customers, or using a failover system in the interim. Whatever the plan ends up being based on your individual situation, having it in place and ready to go is vital.<br /><br /><strong>Consider the cloud</strong><br /><br />Technological advances have increased the power of hackers, but they've also improved our ability to prevent them. Organisations like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> protect against a claimed 72 billion threats per day through leveraging the power of the cloud and more. That's not a typo, by the way, that is 'billion'. On this basis, leveraging services such as Cloudflare, in addition to strong hardware-based solutions (such as <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/our-partners/cisco">Cisco routers</a>), can be a strong consideration to create a holistic security system.<br /><br /><strong>Summary</strong><br /><br />DDoS attacks can come from anywhere, at any time. Being prepared with a plan, as well as having a strong security system to start with, such as a combination of hardware and software, is going to help prevent you from falling victim to malicious attackers.
