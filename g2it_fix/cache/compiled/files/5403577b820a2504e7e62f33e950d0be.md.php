It&rsquo;s easy for small businesses to become complacent &ndash; with many believing data breaches only happen in large companies. No matter your company&rsquo;s size, ransomware can cause millions in damage and undermine consumer confidence. Don&rsquo;t worry, though, because with these simple tips you can safeguard your business from ransomware attacks.<br /><br /><strong>#1 Install a current firewall</strong><br /><br />A firewall ensures no unauthorised traffic can infiltrate your network, and protects your IT system against all ransomware attacks. Traditional firewalls inspect and verify the information data packets offer them. However, next-generation firewalls take things a step further. They inspect all contents of individual data packets, comparing them to known threats. This software catches and quarantines suspect data which other systems may miss.<br /><br /><strong>#2 Update your systems</strong><br /><br />System updates are quite annoying, and often ignored. However, they patch up unseen security flaws and prevent criminals from taking advantage of your system&rsquo;s vulnerabilities. So, you must trust these updates will protect you. This is the simplest way to safeguard your business against malware and ransomware attacks.<br /><br /><strong>#3 Implement disaster recovery solutions<br /></strong><br />Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated. So, even if you have the latest security and highly trained employees, you could be left vulnerable. To protect your business, security must be multi-layered. This provides extra security, even if initial defences do not stand up. A disaster recovery solution is a vital part of multi-layered security. Commonly, this involves the ability to run your company using a backup system.<br /><br /><strong>#4 Install a VPN<br /></strong><br />A lack of remote access leaves many businesses vulnerable. Typically, companies invest in quality on-site online security; however, this doesn&rsquo;t protect travelling or remote employees. For secure remote access, a VPN is essential. It allows remote workers to create &ldquo;virtual tunnels&rdquo;, to corporate networks from anywhere.<br /><br /><strong>#5 Use real-time click-protection</strong><br /><br />Email phishing scams are the key way cyber criminals gain unauthorised access to your computers. As the name implies, it enables people to illegally access your email accounts. From there, they can destroy your business from the inside. To protect yourself, increase protection for your inboxes. We can help you with cybersecurity and data recovery; however, you must remain vigilant by verifying the links come from trustworthy sources.<br /><br />For more advice on protecting your business from ransomware, <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/contact-us">get in touch</a> today: call 1300 325 487 or connect on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/G2ITAustralia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/14527738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.</p>'
