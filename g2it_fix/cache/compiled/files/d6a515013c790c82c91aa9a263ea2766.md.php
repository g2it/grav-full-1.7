<p>What is Multifactor Authentication (MFA)?</p>
<p>Multifactor authentication, or MFA, is the concept used to prove who you are by presenting at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something you know, such as a password or PIN</li>
<li>Something you have, such as an LCD security token or a smartphone</li>
<li>Something you are, such as biometrics, like fingerprints or voice recognition</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="mfa.PNG" alt="" width="600" height="247" /></p>
<p>However, these ways of logging in are not secure. A <a href="https://pages.yubico.com/2019-password-and-authentication-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study conducted in 2019</a>&nbsp;discovered that more than 50% of participants:</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="ACSC-logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<ul>
<li>reuse password and email combinations across multiple platforms</li>
<li>share passwords with colleagues, friends, and family</li>
<li>do not use multi-factor authentication at work or in their personal life.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that more than half of the participants are engaged in risky behaviour, making them an easy target for cyber threats.</p>
<p>While MFA is not a guarantee to protect against cyber-crime, it is recommended by the ACSC that organisations implement MFA as part of a security baseline, known as the <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/essential-eight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Eight</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YubiKey</a> enters the stage.</p>
