        'markdown' => '### What is IT Project Management?

> “IT project management is the process of managing the plan, organisation, and accountability to achieve information technology goals.”
> 

The reach of IT spans across most of a business or enterprise and the scope of these projects can vary – from setting up a new WiFi printer in a small office to complex software implementations over several systems and locations.

The scale of IT projects often means that it’s more than just applying knowledge, aligning skills, and using regular tools and techniques to complete a project. 

G2IT project managers deal with challenges of complex integrations, technology changes, scope creep and any other changes which can occur within the lifespan of a project.
