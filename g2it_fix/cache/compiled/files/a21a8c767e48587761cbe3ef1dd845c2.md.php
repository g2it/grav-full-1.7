Let\'s take a look at some crucial factors you need to consider.<br><br></p>
<h3>Bandwidth requirements</h3>
<p>Do you know how much bandwidth your business uses? It\'s a great place to start when looking to improve your internet connection, as the applications you use and the number of employees you need to support are all critical factors. If you think a lack of bandwidth is causing your internet to become slow, then try monitoring your usage for a month to get a rough idea.</p>

<h3>Data security</h3>
<p>Counteract potential cybersecurity attacks by knowing how to protect personal and business data online. Commercial companies account for around <a href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/cyber-attacks-worsening-among-australian-businesses-costing-economy-1-billion-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43% of cybercrime in Australia</a>, so make sure you have the right internet security for the type of data you handle. In doing so, you can better understand your vulnerability to certain kinds of security threats. For example, ransomware and malware pose more of a risk to some businesses than phishing.<br><br></p>
<h3>Backup plan</h3>
<p>Think ahead by planning a backup for when your internet goes down. Downtime of your website or commercial services could lead to a loss of business-critical traffic as well as productivity, leading to decreased sales and profits.<br><br>One option is to install an <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/blog/internet-failover">Internet Failover System</a>. A system like this will ensure you have a secondary internet connection if your primary connection fails. In doing so, you will maintain a reliable service, presenting your business as resilient and trustworthy to customers.<br><br>If you\'re looking for comprehensive IT services to support your business, G2IT can help.
