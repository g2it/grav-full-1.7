        'markdown' => '### Reliable IT Support Perth, Fremantle & Esperance 

IT support is a broad term that refers to any assistance given with technology-related products and services. In a business setting, the role of an IT technical support engineer is primarily to help monitor and maintain computer systems and networks across an organisation.

### Why do I need IT support?

If you or your staff run into a problem with computers, networks, hardware or software, you can contact the G2IT support teams in Fremantle and Esperance.  We’ll help you get the most out of your systems. 

### Why outsource your IT support?

If you run your own business, especially a small business, you may not have the resources or need to employ a dedicated IT support person so instead you can opt to ‘outsource’ your IT support work to a specialist company.

In doing so, you gain immediate access to experienced, qualified IT experts when you need them and the cost, compared to employing your own IT staff, is heavily reduced.

G2IT is a company offering outsourced IT support services, covering a wide range of services (link to Services) and providing a ‘one-stop-shop’ for your business’ IT requirements. 

G2IT is a well-established IT support provider offering technical expertise, an understanding of the market you are in and what services you may require. 

### Why should I outsource my IT Support to G2 IT? 

We are known for our outstanding customer service (link to reviews) and we focus on delivering high quality IT solutions. On time, every time. 

You can have the peace of mind that support from our qualified IT specialists is available whenever and wherever you need it. 

Do you need 24/7 IT support or a visit from one of our technicians? These and many other support options are available. Whatever your IT support requirements may be, we have you covered!

* Remote IT Support - using our remote software we can get into your computer(s) and find and fix the problem, or determine what corrective action needs to be taken.
* On-site IT Support - if it’s a priority call, we can be on your doorstep within the hour to identify the problem and the right way to fix it.


We have the right option of IT support for all of our clients and are happy to combine options to suit your needs.

Our options of IT support for businesses in Perth and Esperance are split into three different levels. 

### Levels of IT Support

![](5-levels-tech-support.png)

**1st Line – Basic IT support**
Our basic level of support covers simple customer issues such as solving usage problems and fulfilling requests that need our involvement. If we can’t find a solution, we’ll escalate the issue to a higher level of IT support. 

**2nd Line – Medium IT support**
Our in-depth technical support is provided by our experienced and knowledgeable technicians. They assess issues and provide solutions for problems that cannot be addressed within our basic support level. If we are not able to solve your problem using our medium support, we’ll escalate the incident to our advanced support team.

**3rd Line – Advanced IT support**
Our expert product and service support staff have access to the highest technical resources available and use these tools to resolve problems or create new features. Our technicians will attempt to duplicate problems and define root causes, using product designs, code, or specifications. Once a cause is identified, we’ll advise on how to proceed.
