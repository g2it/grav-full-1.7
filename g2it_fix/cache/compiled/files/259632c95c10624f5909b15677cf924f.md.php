<p>Starlink, the low-orbit satellite broadband service set up by Elon Musk\'s SpaceX company, will become available for Western Australian residents this year, with a tentative mid to late 2021 launch date.</p>
<p>The Starlink Kit will cost $709 with an added $100 for shipping and handling.</p>
<p>There are no data caps under the Starlink Beta program and the cost is set at $139 per month. Services and the Starlink Kit are for residential use only.</p>
<p>Users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations. As the Starlink system is still being enhanced over the next several months, there will also be brief periods of no connectivity at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What\'s included in the Starlink Kit?</strong></p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="/blog/starlink-western-australia-2021/Picture2.png" alt="" width="351" height="293" />The Starlink Kit arrives with everything needed to get online, including the Starlink, Wi-Fi router, power supply, cables and mounting tripod. <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/contact-us">G2IT can assist</a> with the installation and calibration of your Starlink system.</p>
<p>You can read more about Starlink Beta here: <a href="https://www.starlink.com/faq">https://www.starlink.com/faq</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But wait, there\'s more!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Starlink app (available for iOS and Android) is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the install location that will ensure the best quality of service</li>
<li>Check for obstructions that can interfere with service</li>
<li>Setup your Starlink hardware</li>
<li>Verify your WiFi connection</li>
<li>Run speed tests</li>
<li>Troubleshoot connectivity issues</li>
<li>Contact support</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Starlink is ideal for rural and remote communities</strong></p>
<p>Starlink is ideally suited for remote areas of Western Australia, where connectivity has typically been a challenge.</p>
<p>Unbounded by traditional ground infrastructure, Starlink can deliver high-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable or completely unavailable.</p>
