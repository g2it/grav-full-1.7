<p><img style="float: right;" src="/blog/myths-surrounding-cyber-security/8%20-%20Five%20myths%20surrounding%20cyber%20security.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="197" />Committing to a robust cyber security strategy is very important if you want to keep your business running safely and smoothly. If you&rsquo;re new to the world of internet and data security, however, and are unsure about how you should be protecting your business and employees online, you may be vulnerable to a number of misconceptions surrounding cyber security. This is why we&rsquo;ve busted a list of common myths below.<br /><br /><strong>Myth #1: Cyber security is dependent entirely on technology</strong></p>
<p>As well as enlisting the latest cyber security technologies, you should protect your business with a comprehensive employee training plan and by implementing clear policies and procedures surrounding data protection. Indeed, one of the primary ways that tech-savvy criminals can get to your precious data is via unsuspecting employees willing to click on suspicious links or hand over sensitive data. Training your employees about issues such as phishing emails will equip them with the knowledge to do their part in protecting your business.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Myth #2: Keeping businesses secure is very expensive</strong></p>
<p>This is simply not true. The training programmes and technologies needed to keep your IT systems secure are becoming increasingly affordable. Remember that by protecting your business you are avoiding the possibility of incurring severe financial hardships in the future. A single data breach can sometimes prove ruinous to a business.<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Myth #3: Cyber security breaches will be covered by insurance</strong></p>
<p>Many standard insurance packages do not cover money lost through data breaches or other security incidents. Even insurance policies that do include cyber security coverage come with a number of caveats that could leave you out of pocket. In this way, it is important to be proactive about protecting your business and employees rather than assuming you will be able to claim money back later.<br /><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Myth #4: Cyber-attacks always stem from external sources</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, cyber-attacks can come from anywhere, including from an employee working at your organisation or with one of your suppliers. Remember that you should not rule anyone out if you&rsquo;re investigating a security issue.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Myth #5: New devices are automatically secure</strong></p>
<p>Just because you have purchased software or devices in a new condition does not mean they are secure. Remember to let your IT and security staff know about any new purchases so they can assess potential security risks.</p>
