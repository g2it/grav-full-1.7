<p><img style="float: right;" src="ACSC-logo.png" alt="" />The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed mitigation strategies to help organisations protect themselves against cyber-attacks.</p>
<p><strong>G2IT can assist you with implementing the Essential Eight Maturity Model</strong></p>
<p>The Essential Eight are designed to protect Microsoft Windows-based internet-connected networks but G2IT can develop mitigation strategies for businesses in Perth, Fremantle and Esperance using alternative systems.</p>
<p>They consist of eight security controls on three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preventing attacks</strong>
<ol>
<li>Application control to prevent the use of unauthorised software</li>
<li>Patching applications to close security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>MS Office macro settings to block untrusted macros</li>
<li>Application hardening to protect against vulnerabilities</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Limiting the extent of attacks</strong>
<ol>
<li>Restricting admin privileges to limit user access to systems</li>
<li>Patching operating systems to close security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication to protect against hacked accounts (for example with <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/our-partners/yubico">Yubico</a>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Recovery</strong>
<ol>
<li>Backups to maintain the availability of critical data</li>
<li>Monthly, weekly, or daily schedule</li>
<li>Restoration of systems, software and data from backups is tested regularly</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Organisations are encouraged to achieve a maturity level that makes sense for the organisation&rsquo;s risk management level. To identify the required level, a <a href="https://www.g2it.com.au/our-services/network-and-security-assessments">risk audit and/or a cybersecurity audit</a> is required.</p>
<p><strong>Which Maturity Level for my business? </strong></p>
<p>How you achieve the Essential Eight Maturity Model for your business depends on the individual circumstances and business environment. A small restaurant has different needs compared to an offshore oil rig or public library. This is where G2IT can help.</p>
