"The WA Government owned Australian Marine Complex Common User Facility (AMC CUF) is a large, integrated facility with a diverse range of infrastructure options to service the Oil & Gas, Resource, Marine and Defence Industries on a project by project basis. Our IT network is correspondingly large and complex, and it makes good sense for us to have it maintained at a Service Level Agreement. We are extremely happy with our choice of G2IT for this â€“ the agreement has been tailored to suit our needs and the response is always first class."
