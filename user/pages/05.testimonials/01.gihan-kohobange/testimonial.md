"It is virtually impossible for Shire of Dundas to have its own IT services considering the limited resources available in the area in which it is situated.

Hence, having a trusted, reliable and competent service provider to provide a full pledged solution for all IT requirements is paramount importance for the sustainability of the operations of the Shire.

We are extremely happy with our IT partner, G2IT. They have provided us a tailor-made, first class IT solution best satisfying our all IT requirements."
