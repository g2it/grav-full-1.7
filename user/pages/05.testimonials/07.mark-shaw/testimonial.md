"We’re all about fun and games, but if our systems fail, so does the fun! That’s why Adventure World has a remote monitoring agreement with G2IT – 24 hours a day, 7 days a week we know of any of our computers, servers or other network equipment goes down or stops responding. When things do go wrong, we also rely on G2IT to get them working again pronto.

We also operate a virtual environment set-up, and the G2IT team were fantastic in helping us set up a stable, reliable and redundant system utilising the Microsoft Hyper-V virtualisation software."
