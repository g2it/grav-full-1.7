# Virtualisation Solutions

Virtualisation is the process of creating a software-based virtual environment such as virtual applications, servers, storage and networks. It is the single most effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for any business size.

Virtualisation and [cloud computing](https://www.g2it.com.au/our-services/cloud-services-fremantle) are interchangeable. Virtualisation is software that creates a computing environment within IT infrastructure, while cloud computing is generally a service that delivers shared computing resources on demand via the Internet. 

You can use our virtualisation solutions as complementary service to cloud computing for even greater agility and self-service.

Virtualisation allows you to:
* operate multiple systems on one computer or server system e.g. a Windows and a Mac environment
* create test environments and prototypes before rolling them out into a live environment
* consolidate old data centre environments
* prepare your business for the move into the cloud

Let’s have a look at the advantages and disadvantages of virtualisation: 

### **Advantages of virtualisation**

**1. Reduced Complexity**
A virtualised infrastructure can help reduce the complexity of your environment. It can simplify operations and maintenance. Virtualisation creates a foundation for more efficient IT management, improved security and allows you to focus on business priorities.

**2. Simplified IT Management**
Managing servers in a physical IT environment is time-consuming. Modern virtualisation management tools include automation capabilities, eliminating the need for IT workers to manually perform routine maintenance and troubleshooting on physical machines. These tools not only make it easy to pinpoint IT issues, but they can also help IT to proactively detect and resolve issues to reduce downtime..

**3. Security** 
Due to the isolated nature of virtual servers, websites and applications are more protected. Virtual security is adaptive and protects your virtual machines from malware and attacks as they migrate from host to host.

**4. Lower Costs**
Your business can significantly reduce expenses and use resources through effective pooling, automation of operational processes, and the use of cloud services.

**5. Flexible IT Service Delivery**
Virtualisation creates a dynamic infrastructure that helps your business react more quickly to changing markets, business conditions, or customer requirements..

**6. Dependable Business Continuity**
Virtualisation and high availability creates an environment that helps ensure all your applications are always accessible. With lower downtimes and increased security, virtualisation with High Availability provides the foundation for disaster recovery planning and preparedness in case of an unexpected event such as a flood, fire, or other disaster.

### **Disadvantages of virtualisation** 

**1. Cost of implementation**
The cost of virtualisation can vary from low and very inexpensive to a large-scale implementation with high availability and failover clustering setup. Hardware and software are required at some point and that means selecting the right supplier with knowledge and experience for virtual environment implementation. The G2IT team will help you to select the right technology partner and virtualisation solution after an initial consultation. We will provide you with detailed costs for your virtualisation project.  

**2. Limitations**
Not every application is going to work well within a virtualised environment. In some cases, it may be best left to a native hardware installation or worth considering cloud service. This means that your business may require a hybrid system to function properly. This can save time and money in the long run. The virtualisation experts at G2IT can review your requirements and provide you with a solution that is tailored to your business’ needs.  

**3. Security risks** 
Some businesses overlook the need to protect their virtualised environments, thinking they're more secure than traditional IT environments. Others assume that the same tools protecting physical infrastructure will secure their virtual infrastructure. Even though virtual environments are more secure than physical environments, they are still prone to attacks and data breaches. The chances of experiencing a data breach while using virtualisation are high but our experts at G2IT will make sure your data is always secured and backed up.  

**4. Availability**
One of the main concerns around virtualisation environment is its availability to services user requests. An example of this request would be: Open a Microsoft Word file, save an Excel spreadsheet, or access a critical database. If you and your staff cannot connect to your virtual environment, you whole business can stop at its tracks. Virtual Server Availability can sometime be out of your control and issues can arise from electricity providers, hardware failure and networking issues or even hackers. The team at G2IT can implement a disaster recovery plan, a redundant solution with full high availability solution so that your downtime can be minimised or removed all together.

### **How to get started with virtualisation?**
Implementing virtual environment is easier than you might think. By partnering with G2IT, we can develop a comprehensive solution with rich capabilities and build a powerful and flexible virtualised infrastructure for your business.
