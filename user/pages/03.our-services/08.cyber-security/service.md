### Cyber Security Perth, Fremantle & Esperance

### What is cyber security?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. Cyberattacks usually try to access, change, or destroy sensitive information; extort money from users; or interrupt normal business processes. Successful protection again cyber-attacks requires the main pillars of a company to work together seamlessly:

**People**

Every user within your organisation has to play their part in complying with basic data security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and following company policies and procedures. Cyber security staff need to stay up to date with the latest risks, solutions and qualifications.

**Processes**

Your organisation should develop frameworks for how you deal with both attempted and successful cyber-attacks. These frameworks should explain how you can identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks. 

**Technology**

Technology is essential to giving your organisation and staff the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, endpoint detection & response, antivirus software, email security solutions and intrusion detection and protection systems.

A successful cyber security approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In your organisation, the people, processes, and technology should all complement one another to create an effective defence from cyber-attacks.

### Types of cyber security threats

**Ransomware**

Ransomware is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.

**Malware**

Malware is a type of software designed to gain unauthorised access or to cause damage to a computer. 

**Social engineering**

Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.

**Phishing**

Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. Itâ€™s the most common type of cyber-attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.
