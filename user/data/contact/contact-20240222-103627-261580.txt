How to troubleshoot a newly built PC that does not show any display?

 
I have recently assembled a PC with the following specifications:

 

 
Motherboard: Asus A620M-A


GPU: RTX 4070


CPU: 7700X


RAM: 32 GB DDR5 5200 MHz


PSU: 750 W


Storage: 1 TB NVMe

 
The PC powers on, but there is no signal on the monitor. I have tried removing and reinserting the GPU and RAM, but it did not help. I have also tried updating the BIOS using the flashback feature, and it worked once, but after putting everything back into the case, the problem returned. I have checked all the cables and connections, and they seem to be fine. What could be the cause of this issue, and how can I fix it?

 
Thank 
 you for your assistance.
