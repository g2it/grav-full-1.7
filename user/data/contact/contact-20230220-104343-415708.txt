Enquiry Details: Hi Mark,
A while ago you came in and looked at our printer as there were streaks on all the pages we printed out. We have been regularly doing the drum cleans and I have even manually cleaned the inside, usually it's just the first few pages we print in the morning that has streaks and then it's fine for the rest of the day. Now all the pages have dark black streaks down them. Do you have any other suggestions on how we can fix this? If not maybe we can look into getting some quotes to replace this printer.
