fighting ring after police raided his home and found veterinary steroids, blood-stained carpets, and a crude electrical device used to execute animals that lost fights. Five dogs were reportedly taken from his home. 
 
Frederick Douglass Moorefield Jr. and an alleged accomplice were arrested last month and charged with promoting and furthering an animal fighting venture, according to a press release published by the US Department of Justice on Monday. They were released pending trial on Thursday. 
 
According to the press release, Moorefield and his co-defendant used an encrypted messaging app to communicate with other dog-fighting trainers, coordinate bouts, and discuss how to keep their activities hidden from law enforcement. Moorefield used the name “Geehad Kennels” to identify his dog-fighting operation, while the accomplice, named as Mario Damon Flythe, called his operation “Razor Sharp Kennels.”
