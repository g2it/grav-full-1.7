Enquiry Details: Hi

We are an IT, Commercial Audio Visual (Digital Signage & VC) & Telecommunications onsite support company based in Australia. Our Head Office is based in Adelaide but we also have offices in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

We have many corporate clients that have sites all across Australia and New Zealand, to reach these locations we use a network of 600+ sub-contractors and are always looking at expanding that network especially in regional and remote locations. As such we are seeking service provider in your area to join our network to support local businesses.

This may include new installations and ongoing service work on existing systems to support local businesses. The majority of the work is troubleshooting with a support desk and swapping over faulty hardware with replacements that are supplied by our client. We also do project based roll outs/installs for large multi-site companies.

If this is something that interests you and you would like to know more then please contact me.

Kind Regards
David Eadie
Service Delivery Manager
