Enquiry Details: Good afternoon

My name is Bradley and I am an ex-Army soldier and now veteran pensioner.

I have recently become enthusiastic about scrapping e-waste, IT and appliances and in turn reducing landfill. 

This hobby has incidentally helped in my recovery from service related PTSD, anxiety and depression.

I am contacting you to let you know that I would be happy to collect any unwanted electronic and IT waste that you may have, for free. I could also provide you with a wheelie bin for ease of disposal and regular collection at your convenience.  

Please feel free to contact me via email or phone anytime and thanks for your consideration. 

Kind Regards

Bradley
