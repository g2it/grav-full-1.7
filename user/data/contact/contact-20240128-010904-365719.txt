Enquiry Details: A look at the key moments in the Israel-Hamas war as the conflict reaches its 100th day 
<a href=https://omg1.shop>omg официальный</a> 
It’s been 100 days since the outbreak of Israel’s war in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed "nobody will stop us" from destroying Hamas as his country faces accusations of genocide at The Hague. 
 
The Israeli military began an offensive on the Palestinian enclave after Hamas militants launched a brutal assault on Israel on October 7, with gunmen killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 200 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. 
 
Since the attack, more than 23,843 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
