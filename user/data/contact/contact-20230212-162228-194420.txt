Enquiry Details: A few months ago, my data was compromised with breaches on Optus,  Medibank and now PayPal (Yet to be Advised of the breach). 
I have taken a few  steps to ensure that my security isn't compromised in the future.
01. Using VPN 
02. New email provider
03. Use of multiple emails
04. Redesign my password system 
05. Changed my phone provider and number.

I have been using my phone a 2FA and want to change to a Yubikey. Going through the internet, I came across your site indicating that you represent Yubicon. How much would a yubikey cost to use on my computer, I would require this to use on my computer to access certain sites requesting 2 FA.

I also have a Ledger device for my investments, would I require a 2nd key?

Looking forward to hearing from you
