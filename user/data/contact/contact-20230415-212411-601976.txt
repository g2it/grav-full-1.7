Enquiry Details: <p><h2><a href="https://eth-ethereum-eth.com/" title="ETH mixer">ETH mixer</a></h2></p> <p>What marks <a href="https://coincoinmi.com/" title="coin mixer">coin mixer</a> out from the crowd is the fact that this crypto mixer is able to process transactions for Bitcoin and Litecoin. There is a minimum deposit requirement for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. The site is able to support a maximum of 5 multiple addresses with confirmation required for all addresses. No site registration is required and there is a referral program in place. Additionally, ETH mixer can provide clients with a letter of guarantee.</p> <p><h2>Bitcoin mixer</h2></p> <p>Another trustworthy mixer is Bitcoin mixer which supports two cryptocurrencies with Ethereum to be added soon. The mixing process is quite typical and similar to the processes on other tumblers. It is possible to set a time-delay option up to 72 hours and a sender has an opportunity to split the transaction, so the funds are sent to several addresses. Thus, sender’s funds are more secured and untraceable.</p> <p><h2>bitcoin mixer tor</h2></p> <p>bitcoin mixer tor offers a unique service with a high degree of confidentiality, which will ensure the anonymity of your payments, by using the mixing of multiple Bitcoin addresses. Our system works quickly, reliably and with a small commission – only after the transfer and receipt of funds to the final address. Of course, all of the data about your transaction will be irretrievably deleted.</p> <p><h2>BTC mixer</h2></p> <p>Two cryptocurrencies are also supported on BTC mixer mixing service. This scrambler is listed because it works quickly and it is reliable. The transaction fee is really low, only the amount of 0.0001 BTC needs to be sent for every extra address. Splitting deposited coins between 5 addresses is also extremely helpful for keeping user’s anonymity. Every user is able to choose an additional option of delaying the payment meaning that the transaction is becoming even more anonymous.</p> <p><h2>Bitcoin tumbler</h2></p> <p>This is by far the most unique Bitcoin tumbler I’ve ever encountered till date; that’s so pertaining to its “Time-travel” feature! (Whoa!) Basically instead of operating on the traditional receive unclean coins > send clean coins process, it instead uses a create wallet > fund it with chips beforehand > receive unclean coins > grant access to the pre-funded wallet process! This lets users spend the clean coins even before the unclean coins were sent to the mixer (because the wallet was pre-funded) and that’s the reason I termed it the time-travel mixer. Also it funds the wallets with “chips” which are not the same thing as Bitcoins, they’re basically the private keys which can be exported to your Bitcoin wallets to fund your wallets with the amount the chips were worth. It also lets users bet their Chips which has a chance of doubling the worth of their chips, other advanced features include merging which lets users combine two big chips into one single chip, or splitting which divides one big chip into two smaller chips. Its fee structure too is an unique- “Pay what you like” feature, which not only adds to user anonymity by randomizing the fee but also makes the service more affordable and customizable. Because users completely control when or how much funds they wish to withdraw, it translates into 100% user control on time-delays and distribution control. No logs are kept after a 7-day retention period; or there also is an option to manually scrub all logs whenever you wish prior to this 7-day period. The minimum deposit limit on the platform is 0.0001BTC.</p>
