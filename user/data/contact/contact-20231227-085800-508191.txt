This shows that airlines are trying to be more environmentally friendly and cut emissions, but they need government support. The biggest challenges with SAF are high costs and limited materials for SAF production. SAF is three to five times more expensive than regular fuel, and currently, it represents less than 0.1% of global jet fuel. Airlines would like to cut emissions by 70%, but large-scale production is difficult. The flight was the first flight to use 100% SAF, but the process of reducing emissions is much slower than in the car industry. 
 
Difficult words: sustainable aviation fuel (fuel which does not use petroleum), challenge (a problem or difficulty), large-scale (involving many people or things).
