The company now owned by Elon Musk has banned global political ads since 2019 but allowed cause-based ads in the US since January. This change could boost X’s revenue as advertisers have been cautious due to content concerns. X plans to counter content manipulation and create an advertising transparency center to display promoted political ads. The company remains committed to barring ads spreading false information or undermining election confidence. Criticized like other platforms, X faces scrutiny for its readiness post-Musk’s acquisition, especially after staff layoffs including trust and safety team members. 
 
Difficult words: counter (to speak or act in opposition to), bar (to prohibit), scrutiny (careful and detailed examination).
