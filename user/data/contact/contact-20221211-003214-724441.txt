Enquiry Details: I am contacting you on behalf of Anet(www.anetusa.net), developer of SureLog SIEM  (Security Information and Event Management) software.

We are looking for managed IT service providers in Australia, which will incorporate SureLog SIEM into their offerings and resell the solution to their clients. We identified G2IT as a potential partner.

SureLog is used for identifying security threats by collecting and analyzing logs from network devices in real time.The system has a strong correlation engine and suitable for midsize enterprises. SureLog can also be used for compliance and for forensic analysis.

Please get back to me for a discussion, if you will be interested in evaluating the partnership opportunity.
