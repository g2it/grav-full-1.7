Enquiry Details: Good morning, my name is Stephen, how are you?  I got your contact on a car as an ad for your business.  A 'message' for you.  

Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  Ephesians 2:8-10 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  

Man by his own merit is unable to save himself but only in grace through faith in and to glory in the power of the cross. The debt was paid on the cross at Calvary with the precious blood shed from Jesus for all of man and his sin. Grace, faith and works are all interlinked but the key is obedient faith to Jesus. What does a servant do? Emulate his master through good works to serve, worship, please, glorify and live in communion with... One must still do works but one cannot rest salvation on it and faith without works is also dead... works of thankfulness/faith or else... In James 2:21-24 Abraham was justified by works by offering Issac for sacrifice and he believed on God imputing unto him righteousness and he was called Friend of God.
