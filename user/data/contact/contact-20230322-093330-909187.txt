Enquiry Details: My Epson ET-M1180 series printer, three years old, has stopped printing. WiFi is working, and printer pretends to print, but only blank pages come out. Same for test pieces. I have performed the head cleaning and nozzle cleaning functions, still no result. I always turn the printer off after use, but perhaps some ink has dried or there is an obstinate air bubble. Do you think it is repairable? Many thanks, Philip
