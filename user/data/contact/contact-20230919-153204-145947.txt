Some people like the ban. But others worry. They are afraid of problems between groups of people. France does not allow religious symbols since 2004. France already bans headscarves. Muslims are very unhappy about it. It is the government’s plan. The government prefers secularism. Secularism is when religious institutions and the state are not connected. 
 
Children, who wear religious clothes, get into trouble. 
 
Difficult words: robe (a long piece of clothing which women wear), ban (an official stop), religious (connected to a god).
