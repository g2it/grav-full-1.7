Enquiry Details: Hi,

I am interested in getting starlink but I have a question in regards to latency aka ping.

Right now from wa to east cost is around 60-80 ping.

Will this ping be reduced to the same speed anywhere in the world?

WIll ping be reduced to the east cost?

East cost is 60-80ms

International is 200+

I keep seeing that the ping for starlink is 20-50ms. Is that for all locations????
