Enquiry Details: Hi,

I am Joel from a Perth-based web design agency and I am reaching out to offer my subcontracting services for website design and redesign projects.

Our current prices for contractors includes the following packages at the following prices (in AUD):

Landing Page (1 page): $300
Basic (4 pages): $500
Business: $1000 (10 pages and includes speed, security, and SEO optimisation)

Our average completion time is 2 weeks and we use WordPress as our CMS with all websites being responsive. Additionally, we can assist with setting up domain, hosting, and email.

As an alternative, we are also happy to offer a referral commission instead if you want to refer clients to us directly. Please let me know if you are interested in partnering with us.

Thank you.
