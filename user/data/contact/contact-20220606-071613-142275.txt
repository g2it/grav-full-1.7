Enquiry Details: To the Manager or whom this may concern,

Hi, I have a 14 year old son, 15 in January next year called Noah. 
We have moved recently from Pingelly so that Noah can get a Traineeship in IT.
Noah loves coding and various areas in IT. 
I believe an interview would help answer questions in regard to Noah's knowledge in IT .
Would you consider taking on Noah for a traineeship? I have already spoken to the education department and they said the first step is to find someone willing to take him on.
Im certain there is somewhere Noah could start as there are many areas in IT and he does love IT. 
Please let me know if you can help or if you know someone that can help.
Thank you for your time and your response would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards
Joanna Niderla
